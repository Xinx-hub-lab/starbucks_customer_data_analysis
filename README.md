# Starbucks Customer Data Analysis

This project aims to study customer demographic groups who actively respond to offer types from the Starbucks rewards app simulation data.

## Project Objectives
1. Identify which offer types generate the highest response rates and revenue. 
2. Understand how different customer segments (segmented by demos like age, gender, income) respond to various offers and identify high-value customer groups.
3. Identify which channels are most effective for reaching customers and driving offer redemptions.
4. Determine the optimal duration and timing for offers to maximize engagement.
5. Calculate the customer lifetime value for different segments and understand how offers influence CLV.


## Datasets
The datasets were downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihormuliar/starbucks-customer-data) and 3 tables are available: `portfolio.csv`, `profile.csv`, `transcript.csv`.

## Note for Import
Arrays within `portfolio.csv` and `transcript.csv` contains **single quotes**, which should be revised to **double quotes** to prevent import error.
